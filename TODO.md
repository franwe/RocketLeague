# Data Processing
- check if sign of velocity makes sense, or maybe has some other coordinate system
- when normalizing, need first __overall__ min/max - not per file
- create fixed train and test set

# pytorch NNet
- gets nan at some point
- make sure to use our loss
-  test maybe without `test_loader`?
